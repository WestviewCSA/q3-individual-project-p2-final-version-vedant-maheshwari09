Week 1:
Push what I have so far (the map reading and command line stuff) to the GitHub classroom repo.
Make a helper class to keep track of the rows, columns, and levels.
Start figuring out the Queue routing approach.

Week 2:
Finish the Queue code and make sure it actually works on the Easy and Medium maps.
Write the code for the Stack routing approach.
Try to get the Optimal (--Opt) routing done too.

Week 3:
Add the extra output stuff like --Outcoordinate, --Time, and printing the solved map.
Test all the different maps and commands to find and fix any bugs so it doesn't crash.
Clean up my code, do a final push to GitHub, and turn it in!
